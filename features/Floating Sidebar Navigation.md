**User Story**: As an admin user, I want a persistent floating sidebar in the admin panel that contains navigation to the Winners List, Settings, and Metrics sections, so I can easily switch between different views.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- The admin panel includes a sidebar that is fixed (always visible) on one side of the screen.
- The sidebar contains menu items for **Winners**, **Metrics**, and **Settings**.
- The **Winners List** view is loaded by default when the admin panel opens, and its menu item is highlighted.
- Clicking on **Metrics** displays the Metrics section; clicking on **Settings** displays the Settings section.
- The sidebar remains visible while switching views.
- The main content area is scrollable independently.
- The implementation uses Material UI components.

**Dependencies**: None."
